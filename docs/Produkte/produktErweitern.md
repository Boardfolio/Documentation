## Additional Product Settings

You have already created one or more products. Now you have the opportunity to refine these products using "Variants," "Related Products," or file attachments.

To configure all of these things, go to your products and click on one of your existing products to navigate to the corresponding product page. The difference from the normal product page is that this time you'll see additional tabs at the top.

## Related Products

:::info
Keep in mind that to use this function, you must have at least 2 products created.
:::

You're probably familiar with this function from other online shops: If you take a closer look at a product, you'll find suggestions for other products related to it. These could be product extensions or products targeting the same audience.

In this window, you can now select products via checkboxes that you want to associate with your product. If you want this relationship to be mutual, you also activate the "Mutual Relationship" checkbox.

## Digital Products and Attachments

To sell a digital asset or provide it to customers, we make use of the "Digital Attachments" tab. Clicking on "Add File" gives you the opportunity to upload it from your local PC or a URL.

Once you have uploaded a file, you can rename it and add a brief description. It's important to set the slider to "Paid" if it's a product you want to sell.

:::danger Set Slider to Paid
If the slider is **not** set to "Paid" but to "Free," **any visitor can download the file WITHOUT purchasing the product.**
:::

If you set the slider to "Free," you can provide preliminary information that can be viewed without purchasing the product (for example, a sample chapter).

# Wholesale Prices

If you want to sell your products to retailers, you can create special prices for this customer group. These are usually 30-40% cheaper. How much you reduce your prices is up to you.

In the "Wholesale Prices" tab, you can create a new tier for your product.

The first thing you need to do now is to switch the membership to "Wholesaler"! Then enter the quantity and the corresponding reduced price. For a product, you can create multiple tiers (as shown in the image). This way, you can also offer a quantity discount when a retailer buys, for example, 5 pieces at once.
