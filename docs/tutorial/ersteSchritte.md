# Let's Create Your Shop!

After successfully registering and being activated by the Boardfolio team, you can log in to your personal backend of the Boardfolio shop [**here**](https://boardfolio.gg/admin/?target=login).

Congratulations! You have now landed in your own backend. To be more precise, the homepage you see in front of you is your [**dashboard**](/documentation/Backend/dashboard). Here, important information such as open orders, revenue, or messages are displayed (you can find more about the dashboard [here](/documentation/Backend/dashboard)). On the left side, you see a menu bar that allows you to navigate to various sub-items. To complete the setup of your shop, let's first navigate to the top item "Account Details".

On this page, you now have the opportunity to set the **display name** of your company/studio as well as a **logo**. If you also want to reveal the approximate location of your studio, you can specify it in the "Location" field.

**Would you like to tell your fans more about yourself?** Great, then take the opportunity of the short description. In this HTML editor, you can greet your fans in your shop with images and text, give insights into your work, or introduce yourself.
